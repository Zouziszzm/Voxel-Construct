# Voxel Construct

Install my-project with npm

MagicaVoxel is a popular voxel-based 3D modeling software that allows you to create 3D pixel art scenes and objects. It's a powerful tool for designing simple and charming 3D worlds, and it's often used for game development, art projects, and animations.

I recently had the pleasure of creating a charming Japanese-style hut and room using MagicaVoxel. It was an enjoyable project that allowed me to capture the serene and traditional atmosphere of a Japanese dwelling. Here's how I did it:

Creating the Japanese-style Room:
I started by launching MagicaVoxel and diving into the world of voxel art. With great care, I meticulously designed the walls, floor, and furnishings of the room. The sliding doors, tatami mats, and traditional Japanese furniture were all carefully crafted to reflect the authentic Japanese aesthetic. Using the software's color palette and shading tools, I brought my room to life, making sure it felt warm and inviting. Once satisfied, I exported the scene as a 3D model, ready to be explored and modified in MagicaVoxel.

Creating the Japanese-style Hut:
For the charming Japanese-style hut, I embarked on a new project within MagicaVoxel. With my vision in mind, I designed the hut's structure with voxels, keeping it rustic and true to Japanese architectural styles. The thatched roof, wooden beams, and quaint entrance were all meticulously detailed. I applied textures and colors to give it an authentic look, ensuring it blended seamlessly with the serene surroundings. Inside, I placed traditional furniture and decor items to complete the atmosphere of a cozy Japanese retreat. Like the room, I exported the hut as a 3D model, ready for further customization.

Feel free to import these files into MagicaVoxel and make any changes or additions to suit your creative vision. It's a delightful journey to craft your own Japanese-style scenes, and I hope you enjoy the process as much as I did!
